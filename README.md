# simple-hangman-game
written using jupyter notebook. code unfinished.

There are still bits of code to add later.
Will later add functions for:
  - a better hangman board
  - a letter bank (previous guesses)
  - use IPython to clear display (no scrolling needing for output)
  
More may be implemented later as I learn.
